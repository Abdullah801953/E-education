          <br />
          is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which
          falls under the command of the government at three levels: central,
          state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and
          the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free
          and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
          children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of
          public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.[7] Education in
          India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early
          childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher
          education, and vocational education. It varies significantly according
          to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender,
          caste, religion, language, and disability. Education in India faces
          many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and
          quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and
          completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability,
          strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and
          technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is
          influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and
          state levels, such as the National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra
          Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday
          Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National
          Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by various
          stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil
          society organizations, academic institutions, private sector entities,
          and media outlets.

          <strong class="strong">Education system in India</strong>
          <br />
          Up until 1976, under the Indian constitution, school education was a
          state subject; states possessed full jurisdiction over making and
          implementing education policies. After the 42nd Amendment of the
          Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the
          concurrent list.[8] This allowed the central government to recommend
          education policies and programmes, even if state governments continued
          to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes.[8] In a
          country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union
          territories, this has created vast differences between states in terms
          of their policies, plans, programmes and initiatives relating to
          school education. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created
          to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and
          policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the
          majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of
          government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the
          number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6
          83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1–8) were
          managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private
          management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools
          established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative
          learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are
          'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is
          shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio
          73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in
          urban areas much lower (36:66).[9]

          <strong class="strong">History of Education in India</strong>
          <br />
          Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
          preceptor after initiation.[34] The education was delivered through
          Gurukula. The relationship between the Guru and his Shishya (students
          /disciples) was a very important part of education.[35] Takshasila (in
          modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning
          institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is
          debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern
          sense, since teachers living there may not have had official
          membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have
          existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a
          Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
          Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in
          the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the
          Pali language.[36] Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist
          monasteries. These institutions imparted practical education, e.g.
          medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly
          visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban
          centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar) and Manassa in
          Nagpur, among others.[citation needed] These institutions
          systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign
          students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli
          grammar, etc. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous
          teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan Empire.[citation
          needed][where?] Shramanas and Brahmanas historically offered education
          by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of
          funds from students or their guardians.[citation needed] Later,
          stupas, temples also became centers of education; religious education
          was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were
          required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders
          was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to
          perform. Arts, crafts, Ayurveda, architecture were taught
